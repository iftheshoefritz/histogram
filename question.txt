On your paper, write a function histogram that takes a list of numbers, e.g.

[1, 1, 5, 3, 5, 5, 9, 7]

And returns a data structure that contains a count of occurrences of each number in the array:

1: 2     5: 3      3: 1    9: 1    7: 1

Just return the data structure, do not worry about output.

(python people - no collections.Counter)
